This showcases some examples of codes I have made.

Hangman.java code
      \t I shared to seniors while volunteering at the long term care home. 
      * This code demonstrates 
             - multiple methods with different purposes  
             - various error traps using while loops
             - random words separated by categories stored in multiple arrays
