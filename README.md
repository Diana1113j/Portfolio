# Portfolio
This showcases some examples of codes I have made using java.

## 1. Hangman Game
[Hangman](https://github.com/Diana1113j/Portfolio/blob/main/Hangman.java)

By clicking this, you will view the project I shared with seniors in the long-term care center.
 * 1 player game : guess the random word generated based on the user's
    * Category Choice
    * Difficulty Mode 
    ### Programming
     * multiple methods to simplify main method 
     * prevent potential errors through while loops
     * give 10 chances to the user with for loops
     * arrays used to store user inputs for word guesses
     
## 2. Collaborative Tic-Tac-Toe Project
[tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/Diana1113j/Portfolio/blob/main/Tictactoe.java)

By clicking this, you will view a collaborative game project made with my classroom peer. 

* 1 player, 2 player game : tic-tac-toe 

    ### Programming 
 * Skipping code that would generate an error
   * Try - catch statements 
 * Make a validInput boolean variable for retrying 
   * validInput = false 
 * methods to determine which player won 
 
 
## 3. What-to-Wear Game
[What to Wear](https://github.com/Diana1113j/Portfolio/blob/main/WhattoWear.java)

By clicking this, you will view my first game project that displays clothing options based on user input, which scored E+ in grade 11 computer science. 
* 1 player game : asks the user for the temperature, precipitation, and to choose whether it is (windy/sunny/cloudy)
* Based on the user input, different combinations of clothing are displayed on screen. 

    ### Programming 
   * if else, nested if statements 
   * demonstrates creative ideas of cases where potential errors could appear
     * system exit if user inputs N for all 3 questions where they must input at least 1 Y
   

## 4. Check-Out System Code 
[Check-out system](https://github.com/Diana1113j/Portfolio/blob/main/checkout.java)

By clicking this, you will view my first retail check-out system code that assisted me in the small store at long-term care home, where there weren't any cashiers. 

* check-out system : outputs most effective coin value when distributing change

   ### Programming
 * stored item name and cost stored in arrays
 * if else statment to determine if user inputed more amount of cash than the total cost
   * system exit if user inputed less cash than the total cost 
 * if else statment for most effective coin choice for the change
   * ex) twoonies, loonies, nickel, dime
